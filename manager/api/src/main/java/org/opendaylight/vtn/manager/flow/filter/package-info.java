 *   Function overview
 * </h2>
 *
 * <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
 *   <p>
 *     Flow filter provides packet filtering feature for packets forwarded
 *     in <a href="../../package-summary.html#VTN">VTN</a>.
 *     Flow filter can not only filter out the specified packets but also
 *     modify the specified packets.
 *   </p>
 *   <p>
 *     Each flow filter must specify a
 *     <a href="../cond/package-summary.html">flow condition</a> by name.
 *     If a packet matches the condition described by the flow condition in a
 *     flow filter, then actions configured in the same flow filter is applied
 *     to that packet.
 *   </p>

 *   Type of flow filter
 * </h3>
 * <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
 *   <p>
 *     There are three types of flow filter as follows.
 *   </p>
 *   <dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
 *     <dt id="type.PASS" style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0.5em;">PASS
 *     <dd style="margin-left: 2em;">
 *       Let the packet through the virtual node if the packet matches the
 *       flow condition configured in a flow filter.
 *       This type of flow filter can be used to modify the specified packets.
 *
 *     <dt id="type.DROP" style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0.5em;">DROP
 *     <dd style="margin-left: 2em;">
 *       Discard the packet if the packet matches the flow condition configured
 *       in a flow filter.
 *
 *     <dt id="type.REDIRECT" style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0.5em;">REDIRECT
 *     <dd style="margin-left: 2em;">
 *       Forward the packet to another virtual interface in the same VTN if the
 *       packet matches the flow condition configured in a flow filter.
 *       This type of flow filter also can modify the matched packet.
 *       See description about <a href="#redirect">packet redirection</a> for
 *       more details.

 * <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
 *   <p>
 *     <strong>Flow action list</strong> is a list of rules to modify packet.
 *   </p>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>
 *       When a <a href="#type.PASS">PASS</a> or a
 *       <a href="#type.REDIRECT">REDIRECT</a> flow filter is applied to
 *       a packet, flow actions configured in the same flow filter are applied
 *       to the packet in order.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *       Although a <a href="#type.DROP">DROP</a> flow filter can have
 *       flow actions, they will be always ignored.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul>
 *
 *   <p>
 *     Note that modification done by flow actions in a flow filter is visible
 *     to succeeding evaluation of flow filters.

 *   Place to configure flow filter
 * </h3>
 * <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
 *   <p>
 *     One or more flow filters can be configured in virtual node in VTN as a
 *     list, and it is evaluated when a packet is forwarded to the
 *     virtual node. Each flow filter has a unique index in the list, and
 *     they are evaluated in ascending order of indices, and only the first
 *     matched flow filter is applied to the packet.
 *     If none of flow filter in the list matches the packet, then the
 *     VTN Manager lets the packet through the virtual node without modifying
 *     the packet.
 *   </p>
 *   <p>
 *     Flow filter can be configured in the following places.
 *   </p>

 *         Flow filters in this list are evaluated when an incoming packet is
