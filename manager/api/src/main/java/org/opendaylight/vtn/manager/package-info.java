 *   <p>
 *     The VTN Manager manages the virtual network at <strong>VTN</strong>
 *     (Virtual Tenant Network) level. At least one VTN should be created for
 *     setting up virtual network using the VTN Manager.
 *   </p>
 *   <p>
 *     VTN is a virtual network environment inside the network manager by the
 *     OpenDaylight controller. The VTN Manager sets up virtual network
 *     environment inside VTN by configuring virtual network elements
 *     (virtual node) like <a href="#vBridge">vBridge</a> in VTN.
 *     If multiple VTNs are created, then networks inside different VTNs are
 *     managed as different individual networks.

 *     <strong>vBridge</strong> is a virtual layer 2 switch inside
 *     <a href="#VTN">VTN</a>, and it represents one virtual broadcast domain.
 *     Virtual network environment in VTN is enabled when one or more vBridges
 *     are created inside VTN, and vBridge and physical network are mapped.

 *     <p>
 *       <strong>VLAN mapping</strong> functionality is used for mapping VLAN
 *       network to any specified vBridge. It is possible to set one or more
 *       than one VLAN mapping to one vBridge.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *       While configuring VLAN mapping, specify the VLAN ID that is to be
 *       mapped to vBridge.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         If <strong>0</strong> is set as VLAN ID, then the ethernet frames
 *         that have no VLAN tag get mapped to vBridge.
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>
 *             If the physical switch receives an ethernet frame that does not
 *             have VLAN tag, then it is treated as an input against this
 *             vBridge.
 *           </li>
 *           <li>
 *             VLAN tag is removed if an ethernet frame is output to this
 *             vBridge.
 *           </li>
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         If a value greater than <strong>0</strong> and less than
 *         <strong>4096</strong> is specified as VLAN ID, then ethernet frames
 *         that have the same VLAN ID inside the VLAN tag get mapped to this
 *         vBridge.
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>
 *             If the physical switch receives an ethernet frame that has this
 *             VLAN ID set inside the VLAN tag, then it is treated as an input
 *             against this vBridge.
 *           </li>
 *           <li>
 *             VLAN tag is added and the corresponding VLAN ID is configured
 *             when ethernet frame is output to this vBridge.
 *           </li>
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       Also, it is possible to specify one physical switch for VLAN mapping.
 *       If the node identifier (node-id) corresponding to physical switch
 *       is specified during VLAN mapping, then only the input and output of
 *       that physical switch is mapped to vBridge. If a physical switch is
 *       not specified, then it will be used for all the physical switches
 *       recognized by the OpenDaylight controller.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *       Further, if the same VLAN ID specified with and without the physical
 *       switch are set to different vBridges, higher priority will be given
 *       to the VLAN mapping specified with the physical switch.
 *       E.g., let us assume that vBridge is configured as shown below.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         Create a vBridge with the name <strong>bridge_1</strong> and

 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         Create a vBridge with the name <strong>bridge_2</strong> and

 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       Following will be the behavior in this case.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         Ethernet frames with VLAN ID <strong>1</strong> will be mapped to

 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         VLAN, mapped by VLAN mapping, will be exclusive for that vBridge.

 *           VTN Manager will map the received packet to

 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *           VTN Manager will try to send the received packet to switch ports

 *           If we leave out the port which received the packet, only

 *       <p>
 *         Once the MAC mapping with the host is activated, the combination

 *         will be exclusive for that vBridge. In the above mentioned

 *       </ul>
 *       <p>
 *         E.g., in the above case, let us assume that there is a host with
 *         MAC address <strong>C</strong> over the VLAN of
 *         <strong>port-1</strong> and VLAN ID <strong>10</strong>.
 *         Here, configure MAC address <strong>C</strong> and VLAN ID
 *         <strong>10</strong> on the Map Allow list of
 *         <strong>bridge_1</strong>, and after that when a packet sent from
 *         MAC address <strong>C</strong> is detected, mapping is activated
 *         between the host with MAC address <strong>C</strong> and
 *         <strong>bridge_1</strong>.
 *       </p>
 *       <p>
 *         However, if a different vBridge <strong>bridge_2</strong> is
 *         created, and MAC address <strong>C</strong> and VLAN ID
 *         <strong>10</strong> are configured in the Map Allow list of
 *         <strong>bridge_2</strong>, the mapping with
 *         <strong>bridge_2</strong> will not be activated even if the packet
 *         sent from the host with MAC address <strong>C</strong> is detected.
 *         This is because port <strong>port-1</strong> and VLAN ID
 *         <strong>10</strong> is exclusive to <strong>bridge_1</strong>.
 *         Therefore, packet sent from MAC address <strong>C</strong> is
 *         discarded.
 *       </p>
 *       <p>

 *     MAC address table
 *   </h4>
 *   <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
 *     <p>
 *       Each vBridge owns a <strong>MAC address table</strong> to learn MAC
 *       addresses detected in the vBridge. The following information is
 *       stored in the MAC address table when an input is detected from the
 *       physical network mapped to the vBridge.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>Source MAC address of ethernet frame.</li>
 *       <li>Port of the physical switch that received ethernet frame.</li>
 *       <li>VLAN ID inside the ethernet frame.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       Further, if source MAC address information of ethernet frame is
 *       registered in the MAC address table, and the physical switch port
 *       that received the ethernet frame and VLAN ID is different from the
 *       information in MAC address table, then the information inside MAC
 *       address table is updated to the information of the received ethernet
 *       frame.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *       If a unicast packet is sent to vBridge and that packet is notified to
 *       OpenFlow controller, then the VTN Manager checks whether the
 *       destination MAC address is registered in the MAC address table.
 *       Following flow entries are configured on the related physical switches
 *       only when it is found in the MAC address table.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         VLAN ID inside ethernet frame is overwritten with the VLAN ID
 *         stored inside the MAC address table.
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         Route to port of the physical switch, which is stored inside
 *         MAC address table, is configured on each switch.
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       If the destination MAC address is not found in the MAC address table,
 *       then this ethernet frame is sent to all the physical networks mapped
 *       to vBridge.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         VLAN ID can be overwritten according to the setting of
 *         <a href="#port-map">port mapping</a> and
 *         <a href="#VLAN-map">VLAN mapping</a>.
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       Only destination MAC address is used as the search key while
 *       searching inside MAC address table. Thus, it is necessary to
 *       configure vBridge in such a manner that ethernet frames that have
 *       the same MAC address as the source address and different VLAN IDs
 *       configured do not flow to the same vBridge.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *       For example, let us assume that the following vBridge and network
 *       devices are configured.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         Create a vBridge with the name <strong>bridge_1</strong> and map
 *         VLAN ID <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> by using
 *         <a href="#VLAN-map">VLAN mapping</a>.
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         Configure <strong>A:1</strong> and <strong>A:2</strong> alias for
 *         network interface of host having the MAC address <strong>A</strong>,
 *         and allocate VLAN ID <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> to
 *         each of the aliases.
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       If the above configurations are done, then ethernet frames that have
 *       the source MAC address <strong>A</strong> and different VLAN IDs will
 *       be treated as an input of <strong>bridge_1</strong>.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         When a packet is sent from alias <strong>A:1</strong>, then an
 *         ethernet frame that has source MAC address as <strong>A</strong> and
 *         VLAN ID <strong>1</strong> will be input to bridge_1.
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         When a packet is sent from alias <strong>A:2</strong>, then an
 *         ethernet frame that has source MAC address as <strong>A</strong> and

 *       <strong>Port mapping</strong> functionality is used to map port of
 *       physical switch to <a href="#vInterface">virtual interface</a> of
 *       <a href="#vBridge">vBridge</a>. Only one port mapping can be set for
 *       one virtual interface. If you want to map ports of multiple physical
 *       switches to one vBridge, then it is necessary to create multiple
 *       virtual interfaces in the vBridge and configure port mapping against
 *       each virtual interface.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *       While configuring port mapping, specify a pair of physical switch port
 *       and VLAN ID that is to be mapped.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         If <strong>0</strong> is set as VLAN ID, then the ethernet frames
 *         that have no VLAN tag get mapped to vBridge interface.
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>
 *             If the specified port of the physical switch receives an
 *             ethernet frame that does not have VLAN tag, then it will be
 *             treated as an input against this vBridge interface.
 *           </li>
 *           <li>
 *             VLAN tag is removed when ethernet frame is output to this
 *             vBridge interface.
 *           </li>
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         If a value greater than <strong>0</strong> and less than
 *         <strong>4096</strong> is specified as VLAN ID, then ethernet frames
 *         that have the same VLAN ID inside the VLAN tag get mapped to this
 *         vBridge interface.
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>
 *             If the specified port of the physical switch receives an
 *             ethernet frame that has this VLAN ID set inside the VLAN tag,
 *             then it is treated as an input against this vBridge interface.
 *           </li>
 *           <li>
 *             VLAN tag is added and the corresponding VLAN ID is configured
 *             when ethernet frame is output to this vBridge interface.
 *           </li>
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *
 *     <p>
 *       Please note the following caution while configuring port mapping.

 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         Combination of the physical switch port and VLAN ID (including 0)
 *         that was specified during port mapping, will be exclusive to that
 *         vBridge interface. It is not possible to map the combination of
 *         physical switch port and VLAN ID to another vBridge interface if it
 *         has been already mapped to a vBridge interface.
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         Input and output against the internal ports (ports that are
 *         connected to another switch) of a switch will not be managed by
 *         port mapping.
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>
 *             If the internal port of switch is mapped to

 *     <p>
 *       Basically, flow filter can be applied to unicast packets.
 *       So flow filter ignores broadcast and multicast packets except for
 *       <a href="#flow.filter.type.DROP">DROP</a> flow filter.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *       For example, a broadcast packet is mapped to the VTN, flow filters

 *       evaluated as follows.
 *     </p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         A flow filter is ignored if its type is

 *         <a href="#flow.filter.type.REDIRECT">REDIRECT</a>.
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         A flow filter is evaluated if its type is

 *         matches that flow filter, then the packet is discarded.
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <p>
 *       If an unicast packet is mapped to the vBridge, and its destination
 *       MAC address is not learned in the vBridge, the packet is broadcasted
 *       to all physical network elements mapped to the vBridge.
 *       In that case all <a href="#flow.filter.type.REDIRECT">REDIRECT</a>
 *       flow filters configured in the vBridge and vBridge interface for
