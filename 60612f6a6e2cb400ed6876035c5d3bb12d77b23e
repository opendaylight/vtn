      "message": "I\u0027m seriously taking your advice.\n\nHowever, even if I remove the vtn-manager-neutron from odl-vtn-manager-all, the odl-vtn-manager-all cannot be part of compatible-with-all feature.\n\nVTN Manager handles OpenFlow messages (e.g. PACKET_IN), and sends OpenFlow messages (e.g. PACKET_OUT and FLOW_MOD) even when without any configuration related to VTN.\nThis VTN Manager\u0027s behavior is inconsistent with arphandler and l2switch.\n\n(If we change VTN Manager\u0027s behavior to do nothing when there is no vtn configuration, we can put vtn manager without neutron feature to the compatible-with-all feature. But, right now, I\u0027m not sure that is the right direction. I have to discuss it with other people. Anyway, I would like to concentrate to adding ovsdb features in this patch.)",
