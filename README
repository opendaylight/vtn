OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN)
=========================================

## Overview

OpenDaylight VTN provides multi-tenant virtual network functions on
OpenDaylight controller. OpenDaylight VTN consists of two parts:
VTN Coordinator and VTN Manager.

VTN Coordinator orchestrates multiple OpenDaylight Controllers, and provides
applications with VTN API.

VTN Manager is a set of OSGi bundles running in OpenDaylight Controller.
Current VTN Manager supports only OpenFlow switches. It handles PACKET_IN
messages, sends PACKET_OUT messages, manages host information, and installs
flow entries into OpenFlow switches to provide VTN Coordinator with virtual
network functions.

The requirements for installing these two are different. Therefore, we
recommend that you install VTN Manager and VTN Coordinator in different
machines.
